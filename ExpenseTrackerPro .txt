## 1. PROJECT TITLE

 **Expense Tracker Pro – A Smart Online Expense Management System**


---

## 2. INTRODUCTION

Expense Tracker Pro is a modern, web-based application created to help users record, track, and analyse their daily expenses.
Unlike traditional Python scripts that run only on a local computer, this project is fully deployed on the cloud using Streamlit, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, without downloading code.

The project allows users to add expenses, view history, check totals, generate analytics, and provides a secure Admin Dashboard protected through encrypted Streamlit Secrets (TOML-based authentication).


---

## 3. OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT

1. To provide an accessible online expense tracking application.
2. To convert a Python console application into a professional web UI.
3. To ensure multi-user availability without downloading or running Python code locally.
4. To add admin-level analytics and dashboards for deeper insights.
5. To protect the admin panel using secure environment variable login.

## 6. HOW IT WORKS (WORKFLOW)

Step 1 — User Opens the App

App loads with title Expense Tracker Pro.

Step 2 — User Adds an Expense

Select category

   Enter description
   Enter amount

   Click “Add Expense”
   → Expense saved instantly in expenses.csv


Step 3 — Expense Stored

     Pandas writes the entry in CSV format:
     Date, Category, Description, Amount

Step 4 — View History

     User can see all previously added expenses in table format.

Step 5 — Admin Login

    Admin opens “Admin Panel” → enters username & password
    Authentication checked using:
    ADMIN_USER = st.secrets["ADMIN_USER"]
    ADMIN_PASS = st.secrets["ADMIN_PASS"]
    If matched → Admin Dashboard opens.

Step 6 — Admin Dashboard

Shows:

Total expenses
Total transactions
Category-wise spending
Analytics charts

## 7. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  Client Side
      .  Any browser
      .  Internet connection

 Server Side
      . Streamlit Cloud hosting

Monthly charts & reports
Export to PDF/Excel
Voice input for expenses
Multi-user accounts
Email notifications
Cloud database (Firebase / MongoDB)
Mobile app version



---

## 11. CONCLUSION

Expense Tracker Pro successfully transforms a local Python expense-tracking script into a secure, cloud-based web application.
It demonstrates concepts of:

Python programming
Web development using Streamlit
Data handling using Pandas
Cloud deployment
Secure environment variable management


The project is fully functional and accessible via a live link, making it practical for real-world everyday use.
